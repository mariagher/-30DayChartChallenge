**30 Day Chart Challenge 2023**

This repository contains my submissions for the 30 Day Chart Challenge 2023, an annual event where participants create a data visualization every day for 30 days based on a set of prompts. I'll be using R to create my visualizations, and I'll do my best to participate in the challenge, although I'll not have time to create one dataviz every day :) 

Feel free to explore my submissions and use them as inspiration for your own data visualization projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks for checking out my work!
